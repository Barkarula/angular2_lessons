## Directives
## Components

# Architecture Overview

Angular runs on **Components**, The starting point of an Angular app is the **Bootstrap** component.

> NOTE: In Angular 2, A Component is actually *A Directive with a Template*

> There are 2 types of Directives
- **Structural**  - Structural Directives modify layouts, by altering elements in the DOM
- **Attribute** - Attribute Directives change the behaviour/appearance of an existing DOM element

> A **Pipe** takes end data, like a string or an array, and runs some logic to transform it to a new output.
